# Music Genre Classification using Deep Convolutional Neural Network

## Description ##
In this tutorial, we will try to classify music genre using Deep Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) in music file. CNN is powerfull as image classification model, so why do we need CNN in music that literally sound? the answer is we can extract features from music sound like **spectogram** that can be 2D (time, frequency) like images. so lets get started.
